# Mastermind-ShellWindow
This is a masterMind game that will randomly generate a four element secret pattern of colors. The user must guess the right order and right colors to win. This program will print to the shell window and ask the user to enter in a pattern as a guess. If the user correctly guesses the colors, but mixes up the order of the colors. Then the program will print to the shell window telling the user how many colors they guessed correctly and how many of those colors they got in the right pattern.
